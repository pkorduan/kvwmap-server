# - Where to Log -

                    # stderr, csvlog, jsonlog, syslog, and
                    # eventlog, depending on platform.
                    # csvlog and jsonlog require
                    # logging_collector to be on.

# This is used when logging to stderr:
logging_collector = on          # Enable capturing of stderr, jsonlog,
                    # and csvlog into log files. Required
                    # to be on for csvlogs and jsonlogs.
                    # (change requires restart)

# These are only used if logging_collector is on:

                    # can be absolute or relative to PGDATA
log_filename = 'pgsql-%Y-%m-%d.log' # log file name pattern,
                    # can include strftime() escapes
log_file_mode = 0640            # creation mode for log files,
                    # begin with 0 to use octal notation

                    # happen after that time.  0 disables.
log_rotation_size = 0           # Automatic rotation of logfiles will
                    # happen after that much log output.
                    # 0 disables.
log_truncate_on_rotation = on       # If on, an existing log file with the
                    # same name as the new log file will be
                    # truncated rather than appended to.
                    # But such truncation only occurs on
                    # time-driven rotation, not on restarts
                    # or size-driven rotation.  Default is
                    # off, meaning append to existing files
                    # in all cases.

# These are relevant when logging to syslog:

#syslog_split_messages = on

# This is only relevant when logging to eventlog (Windows):
# (change requires restart)
